hello world
I created this new file to encouraging synergies beetween Reaper.fm and Musicoin.org
Respecting the SWS quote Simple & Mighty, we'll try to better integrate them

The goal for this extension is 
1) Simplify artists and producers song releases process
2) Simplify Music collaboration
3) Engage listeners and fans to the music production
4) Allow listeners and fans to encourage with tips and message the production

Here some first extensions to make it real 
1) Release songs with PPP smartcontract directly from Reaper to Musicoin platform. 
2) Integrate Reaper to Musicoin desktop  wallet
3) Purchase Reaper using $music
4) Better determinate parts for smart contract in collaborative projects
5) Share with listeners and fans all new improvements for receiving tips during song creation
6) Share with listener improvements for let them join into the production
7) Integrate https://musicoin.org/nav/release-manager to Reaper DAW

Here it I want to share with you the Ambassador process to
https://github.com/lorenzopistolesi/Ambassador-Process.git

Both Reaper Musicoin extensions and Ambassadors Process
could participate to create Proof of Sharismo.

Musician could share directly with their fans


Simple and Mighty
